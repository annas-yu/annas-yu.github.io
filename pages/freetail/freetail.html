            I joined the Freetail Family in the second semester of my freshman year. Freetail Hackers is the 
            largest student-run hackathon group in Texas, organizing and managing multiple events per year. 
            <p>I work among a smaller team of other designers in order to create assets and design all the 
                creative elements that go into running a hackathon. This includes illustrations that are utilized 
                towards(but not limited to) event website design/layouts, promotional graphics and videos on social 
                media platforms, and swag for our participants like t-shirts, stickers, and pins. 
            <p>Our biggest event of the year is <strong>HackTX</strong>, which hosts over 700 participants a year.
            <br><br>
            I work among a group of people who constantly grow and learn together, all while running these events 
            that are creating a conscious impact on our participants. Though most of my personal work is within the 
            creative team, the communication with my friends at corporate, logistics, outreach, and tech has taught 
            me a great deal outside of design.

            Our Learn-a-thon event was our spring 2021 events targeted to beginner coders and people of all backgrounds 
            who were interested in learning about technology. Over this 2-day virtual event, we hosted multiple 
            beginner-friendly workshops about multiple skills and programs that allowed our participants to participate 
            in a hackathon on the second day. We had over 100 participants at this event, who had access to a board of 
            mentors as they created!

        Below you can see our website, which was designed in its entirety by our creative team, from  all its animations to 
        illustrations. We were able to implement all of our designs in conjunction with the Tech Team, who completed and 
        hosted the physical site.

            In addition to all this, I was able to create a few additional projects that allowed us to properly promote our event on social media platforms. 
            <p>(Left) You can see here a short animation that I created in Premiere Pro to increase engagement and promote on Instagram Stories.</p>
            <p>(Right) Additionally, I designed a Facebook profile picture frame that allowed our members to further promote our event on their personal socials.</p>
